# MatNet
Codes for the neural MAT_NET decoding algorithm in "A Deep Neural Network Architecture for Decoding Linear Codes Based on the Parity Check Matrix":

The codes are written in tensor-flow version '1.15.2'. There are six folders corresponding for the six codes considered in the paper. Each folder contains:
- G and H matrices of a code, 
- a python code for training a network
- a folder containing the saved model
- a python code for testing the saved model

Please change the paths in the python codes to paths in your system and execute the python codes.
